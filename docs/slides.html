# STAT 436: Statistical Data Visualization

## Fall 2024



---


### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

### Syllabus

* Learning outcomes
* Teaching team and office hours
* Assessments
* Grading

---

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Develop a vocabulary of visual encodings that support exploration of
geospatial, temporal, tree-structured, and network data, and demonstrate
facility implementing them using packages in the R programming language.
1.	Design dynamic queries that support interactive visualization of
heterogeneous data, and demonstrate facility implementing them using the shiny
package in the R programming language.
1.	Design effective visualizations to summarize the results of dimensionality
reduction and clustering algorithms.

---

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Use visual artifacts derived from complex statistical and machine learning
models to discuss the patterns they learn and mistakes they make.
1.	Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of visualizations in relation to the tasks
they support.

  - I recommend using Rstudio
  - You can install the tidyverse package using
  

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse") 
```

---

### Advice from Previous Students

* Past Portfolios: [https://go.wisc.edu/hllk12](https://go.wisc.edu/hllk12/)
* Past Advice: [https://go.wisc.edu/l76v31](https://go.wisc.edu/kma1mv)

"Use the notes and recordings that are provided before class"

"You can focus on following along with the demos as opposed to trying to copy down every line of the code"

"Downloading the final solution and adding in comments to it can be helpful for understanding"

"Use the portfolio homework as a way to train your EDA / Visualization skills. Choose topics that are interesting to you so you will have the motivation to create super interesting analysis and graphs!"

---

### Exercise 1 - 1

1. Introduce yourself to your neighbors. Share your name, degree program, and
one of: a recent hobby, favorite movie, favorite food.

1. Submit a response to [Formulating Questions] on Canvas and share your chosen
dataset with your neighbors.

1. We will not grade the plot's quality -- we just want to get a sense of
everyone's starting point.

---

### Exercise 1 - 1

[Formulating Questions] Pick a dataset from
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#datasets), [Data Is
Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0),
[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Google Dataset
Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), or your own personal
studies that you would like to visualize this semester. 

a. What makes you interested in this dataset? What questions does it help to answer?

b. Using any tools of your choice, make one example visualization from your
    dataset. What was your thought process behind the design of this
    visualization? This will not be evaluated except for effort -- the purpose
    of the problem is to create a record your data visualization skills at the
    start of the course. Submit both your visualization and code used to create
    it.

### Exercise Review

.center[
  &lt;img src="figure/info-food-waste.png" width=700/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review

&lt;!-- * What is the meaning of these scales? Are 20 million slices of bread really
comparable to 290,000 kg of poultry? What about CO2 equivalents?
* A barchart would make quantitative comparisons much easier, especially for
smaller circles
* Bright pink background...
* The text is sometimes quite small
* Are apples really vegetables??
* The icons are nice --&gt;

---

### Exercise Review

.center[
 &lt;img src="figure/mosquito-predators.jpeg" width=600/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review
&lt;!-- 
* This is actually quite elegant, though the visualization form is not that
standard.
* Several responses commented that additional labeling or color would help. Some of the existing annotation lacks context. I
would caution that these additions should not come at the cost of the current
information density.
* In an interactive version, it would be nice to be able to filter by predation
type --&gt;

---

### Exercise Review

.center[
 &lt;img src="figure/elife_sunflower.jpeg" width=500/&gt;
]

---

### Exercise Review

&lt;!-- * This is a very dense visualization, appropriate for a scientific venue, but
requiring significant time to parse (though if a lot is learned through the
process, this need not be a bad thing)
* Having the scatterplot icons look like the properties of the sunflowers they
are studying was a brilliant idea.
* The linking of the same color across many subplots is a good practice.
However, the circle sizes are not consistent between (a) and (b).
* Some of the text makes the figure unnecessarily busy. E.g., do we really need
to know latitude and longitude? --&gt;

---

### In-Class Demo [2 - 1]

We will work through [Plant Growth Experiment] in the exercises sheet.

* Live Demo: https://go.wisc.edu/
* Whiteboard: https://go.wisc.edu/
* Completed Code: https://go.wisc.edu/

---

### Notebook Submissions

* Make sure to remove extraneous package loading messages from your
exercise and homework solutions.
* There are also ways to customize the output colors, fonts, etc.
* Let's look at how to do this with the previous demo.

---

### In-Class Exercise [2 - 1]

* Submit an answer to [Code Analysis] from the exercises sheet.

[Code Analysis] Pick one code example from this week’s lecture notes. Provide a
3 - 4 sentence summary of the overall implementation strategy. Then, add
comments every 10 - 15 lines describing what each section of code is doing. If
there are parts that you do not understand, add a ??? next to it (we will review
these in the next lecture).

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- The theme only applies to visualizations **after** the `theme_set` call. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- # set the theme --&gt;
&lt;!-- my_theme &lt;- theme_bw() + --&gt;
&lt;!--   theme( --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.title = element_text(size = 16), --&gt;
&lt;!--     legend.title = element_text(size = 16), --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.text = element_text(size = 14), --&gt;
&lt;!--     legend.text = element_text(size = 14), --&gt;
&lt;!--     strip.text = element_text(size = 16) --&gt;
&lt;!--   ) --&gt;
&lt;!-- theme_set(my_theme) --&gt;
&lt;!-- #?? I don't know why the theme doesn't setted.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- theme_set(theme_grey()) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- ggplot(mtcars) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_point(aes(mpg, hp)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- my_theme &lt;- theme_bw() + --&gt;
&lt;!--   theme( --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.title = element_text(size = 16), --&gt;
&lt;!--     legend.title = element_text(size = 16), --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.text = element_text(size = 14), --&gt;
&lt;!--     legend.text = element_text(size = 14), --&gt;
&lt;!--     strip.text = element_text(size = 16) --&gt;
&lt;!--   ) --&gt;
&lt;!-- theme_set(my_theme) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ggplot(mtcars) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_point(aes(mpg, hp)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- th &lt;- theme_minimal() + --&gt;
&lt;!--   theme( --&gt;
&lt;!--     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), --&gt;
&lt;!--     panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f7f7f7"), --&gt;
&lt;!--     panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "#0c0c0c", size = 0.6), --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.text = element_text(size = 14), --&gt;
&lt;!--     axis.title = element_text(size = 16), --&gt;
&lt;!--     legend.position = "bottom" --&gt;
&lt;!--   ) --&gt;
&lt;!-- theme_set(th) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- The plants demo used a regular expression ("regex") to extract the day number --&gt;
&lt;!-- from the column names. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- plants_reshaped &lt;- plants |&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--   pivot_longer(starts_with("height")) |&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--   mutate(day = str_extract(name, "[0-9]+")) #??? --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- str_extract("height.14", "[0-9]") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- str_extract("height.14", "[0-9]+") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- str_extract("height.14.test.21", "[0-9]+") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- str_extract_all("height.14.test.21", "[0-9]+") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- Hint: https://regexr.com/ is useful for learning and testing regexes. --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- * The first two arguments (`day` and `value`) always define the x and y axes in any ggplot layer --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `interaction` defines a temporary factor variable that looks at all combinations --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- ggplot(plants_reshaped) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_line(aes(day, value, group = interaction(plantid, treatment), col = treatment)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- `group` specifies what each line should correspond to. So here, it corresponds --&gt;
&lt;!-- to `plantid x treatment` combinations. --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- interaction(1:4, c("A", "B", "C")) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- plants_long &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qg9gwk2ldjdtcmmmiropcunf34ddonya.csv") |&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--   pivot_longer(starts_with("height"), names_to = "time", values_to = "height") |&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--   separate("time", c("dummy", "time"), convert = TRUE) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- ggplot(plants_long) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_point(aes(time, height)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review 2 - 1 --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- ggplot(plants_long) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_point(aes(interaction(time, treatment), height)) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

### In-Class Exercise [2 - 2]

Work through [Ikea Furniture] part (a) in the exercise sheet.

As you prepare your solution, respond to the [Code Diary] (https://go.wisc.edu/62wr52) questions.

If you finish part (a) during class, try to complete (b - c) as well.

---

[Ikea Furniture] The dataset below shows prices of pieces of Ikea furniture.
We will compare prices of different furniture categories and label the
(relatively few) articles which cannot be bought online.


``` r
ikea &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/iat31h1wjg7abhd2889cput7k264bdzd.csv")
```
a. Make a plot that shows the relationship between the `category` of furniture
and `price` (on a log-scale). Show each `item_id` as a point -- do not aggregate
to boxplots or ridgelines -- but make sure to jitter and adjust the size the
points to reduce the amount of overlap. _Hint: use `geom_jitter`._

b. Modify the plot in (a) so that categories are sorted from those with highest
to lowest average prices.

c. Color points according to whether they can be purchased online. If they
cannot be purchased online, add a text label giving the name of that item of
furniture.

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is the original histogram, without any faceting by category. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- ikea &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/iat31h1wjg7abhd2889cput7k264bdzd.csv") %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--           filter(category %in% c("Tables", "Bookcases", "Beds", "Cabinets", "Sofas", "Wardrobes")) --&gt;
&lt;!-- p &lt;- ggplot(ikea) + --&gt;
&lt;!--   geom_histogram(aes(log(price))) --&gt;
&lt;!-- p --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review (Part (a)) --&gt;

&lt;!-- .pull-left[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `facet_grid` controls whether we explicitly arrange facets along rows or columns. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * If we place the variable before the `~`, it arranges them along rows. --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- .pull-right[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r, fig.height = 3.9, fig.width = 4} --&gt;
&lt;!-- p + facet_grid(category ~ .) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review (Part (b)) --&gt;

&lt;!-- .pull-left[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- * The remaining plots all use `facet_wrap` --&gt;
&lt;!-- * By default, the axes all use the same scale, which rules out (ii) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * By default, the facets are sorted alphabetically, which rules out (iv) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- .pull-right[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4} --&gt;
&lt;!-- p + facet_wrap(~ category) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review (Part (c)) --&gt;

&lt;!-- The only plot with different `\(y\)`-axes per facet is plot (iii). --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4} --&gt;
&lt;!-- p + facet_wrap(~ category, scales = "free_y") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review (Part (d)) --&gt;

&lt;!-- `axes = "separate"` is not an actual option in `facet_grid` --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- p + facet_wrap(~ category, axes = "separate") --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review (Part (e)) --&gt;

&lt;!-- Looking at the `\(x\)`-axis values of plot (iv), we can see that the facets are --&gt;
&lt;!-- sorted from those with the lowest to those with the highest average price. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4, out.width = 600} --&gt;
&lt;!-- p + facet_wrap(~ reorder(category, price)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- _Whenever possible, each panel in a faceted plot should be made to have its own `\(y\)`-axis scale._ --&gt;

&lt;!-- False: Readers generally assume the facets have the same axes scales. Free --&gt;
&lt;!-- scales should only be provided if the resulting figure would not be legible --&gt;
&lt;!-- otherwise. In this case, the caption should highlight the fact that the scales --&gt;
&lt;!-- are not the same across facets. --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- _When using the `patchwork` package, two plots `p1` and `p2` can be placed side-by-side using `p1 / p2`._ --&gt;

&lt;!-- False: `/` places panels on top of one another. To place them side by side, we --&gt;
&lt;!-- can use `+`.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- _When using the `patchwork` package, the `plot_layout` function can be used to collect legends._ --&gt;


&lt;!-- True: This can be done by calling `plot_layout(guides = "collect")`. --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- _Relative to interactively filtered displays, faceted plots are less taxing on the reader's memory._ --&gt;

&lt;!-- True: Faceting requires more space, but it allows comparisons to be made without --&gt;
&lt;!-- having to recall the previous interactive view. Tamara Munzner calls this --&gt;
&lt;!-- principle, "Eyes beat memory." --&gt;

---

### Discussion [4 - 1]

### Shiny Apps in Problem Sets

If you tried compiling a Shiny app within an rmarkdown document, you probably
saw a message like the one below,

&lt;img src="figures/shiny_rmarkdown.png"/&gt;

You did not make a mistake! Shiny doesn't allow you to host an app within an
Rmarkdown document, unfortunately.

---

### Shiny Apps in Submissions

To let us grade your Shiny apps within the problem sets, you have two options,

1. Include a screen recording of your app along with the code you used to create
it. You do not need to share the code as R scripts -- we will just read the code
as it's embedded in the main write-up.

1. You could try hosting your app on a public site.

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

In addition to printing to the R console or inserting a `browser()` call, you
can create UI elements that print variables of interest.
  * `verbatimOutput` will print arbitrary R objects to the shiny UI
  * Remind me to give examples during our demo today.


``` r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  output$debug &lt;- verbatimOutput({
    # intermediate data structure 
  })
}
```

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

A general principle for debugging: If you are very stuck, it helps to simplify
the problem. Pare away parts of the code that seem unrelated to the bug until
you arrive at a minimal example that reproduces the same buggy behavior. In the
process, you may discover the solution, and even if not, you will have a version
of the code that others can easily give feedback on.

---

### In-Class Discussion [5 - 1]

Prompt: Right now, the dotplot responds to the brushed histogram. However,

  * The dotplot does not allow any user inputs.
  * The histogram does not reflect year or user selections.

Imagine someone came to your statistical consulting hours with this application.
They want your expertise to improve the app so that it conveys more information.
How would you approach this? What might be some first steps towards
implementation?

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- Let's look at the most streamed song of 2017, which was "Shape of You." The --&gt;
&lt;!-- dataset --&gt;
&lt;!-- [here](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv) --&gt;

### Learning Outcome 1

Develop a vocabulary of visual encodings that support exploration of geospatial,
temporal, tree-structured, and network data, and demonstrate facility
implementing them using packages in the R programming language.

* tsibble
* Trends and seasonality, explain lag
* Vector and raster data

---

### tsibble

* Data structures for storing time series data
* Must include temporal `index` column. This specifies the sampling frequency.
  * Optionally includes a `key` for working with collections of time series


``` r
library(tsibble)
head(tourism)
```

```
## # A tsibble: 6 x 5 [1Q]
## # Key:       Region, State, Purpose [1]
##   Quarter Region   State           Purpose  Trips

```

---

### tsibble

* Why are `data.frames` useful? In theory, couldn't we always use lists of lists?
* A similar justification applies to `tsibble`. When we can assume more properties, we can write more tailored functions.

library(feasts)
tourism |&gt;
  filter(Region == "Alice Springs", Purpose == "Holiday") |&gt;

### Time Series properties

From [notes 6 - 2](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat436_s24/posts/2024-12-27-week06-02/),

* Trend: A long-run increase or decrease in a time series.
* Seasonal: A pattern that recurs over a fixed and known period.
* Cyclic: A rising and falling pattern that does not occur over a fixed or known period.

---

### Vector Data

See [notes 7 - 1](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat436_s24/posts/2024-12-27-week07-01/):

* Vector data formats are used to store geometric information (esp. points, lines, and polygons).
* Can be read in using `read_sf` and visualized using `tm_dots`, `tm_lines`, and `tm_polygons` layers, for example.

### Learning Outcome 2

Design dynamic queries that support interactive visualization of
heterogeneous data, and demonstrate facility implementing them using the shiny
package in the R programming language.

* Reactivity in Shiny
* How to write out Shiny code
* Brushing in Shiny

---

### Reactivity

From _Mastering Shiny_

&gt; The key idea of reactive programming is to specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all related outputs are automatically updated.

The execution of reactive code depends on the user's inputs.

---

### Reactivity

For any type of interactive visualization (in Shiny or otherwise), it's worth
thinking carefully about the reactive graph:

* What are potential user inputs?
* What outputs needs to be changed in response?
* How do intermediate data structures need to be changed?

---

### Reactivity

&lt;iframe src="https://connect.doit.wisc.edu/content/dc907aa5-090e-410e-8f9f-6bdb19befc75/" allowfullscreen="" data-external="1" height=500 width=800&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

### Reactivity

&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krisrs1128/stat479_s22/main/_posts/2022-02-10-week04-02/figures/reactive_histo.png" width=800&gt;
&lt;/img&gt;

---

### Brushing

The usual recipe for is:

* Ensure the `plotOutput` is given a `brush`.
  - Optionally, use `brushOpts` to constrain brush direction
* Define a `reactiveVal` to store updated brush selections
* Create an `observeEvent` to check for brush events and update the `reactiveVal` above using `brushedPoints`

---

### Brushing

From the [week 5 - 2 notes](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat436_s24/posts/2024-12-27-week05-02/).


``` r
ui &lt;- fluidPage(
   plotOutput("plot", brush = "plot_brush")
 )
```

---

### Brushing

From the [week 5 - 2 notes](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat436_s24/posts/2024-12-27-week05-02/).


``` r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  selected &lt;- reactiveVal(initial value)
  observeEvent(
    input$plot_brush,
    ... computation using get new_value ...
    selected(new_value)
  )

  output$plot &lt;- renderPlot(... use scatter() reactive val...)
}
```

---

### Learning Outcome 5

Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of visualizations in relation to the tasks
they support.

* How to decide what type of visualization you should make by looking at the data.

---

### Visualization Design/Critique

How to decide what type of visualization you should make by looking at the data.

* Determine the data types/interpretation for each column separately
* Make a list of potentially interesting questions
* For each question,
  - What are the relevant variables?
  - How do they need to be compared?
  - Which should be prioritized?
* Determine visual encodings using data type + prioritization
* Recognize parallel structure (for small multiples)

---

### Visualization Design/Critique

Determine visual encodings using data type + prioritization

For example, if we had a categorical + continuous variable, we could consider:

* `geom_boxplot`: `\(x\)`-axis `\(\to\)` category, `\(y\)`-axis `\(\to\)` continuous value
* `geom_histogram`: 
  - `\(x\)`-axis `\(\to\)` continuous value, color `\(\to\)` category
  - `\(x\)`-axis `\(\to\)` continuous value, facet `\(\to\)` category
* `geom_point` or `geom_jitter`: `\(x\)`-axis `\(\to\)` category (with jitter), `\(y\)`-axis `\(\to\)` continuous value

---

### Visualization Design/Critique

&lt;img src="figure/channels.png" width=750/&gt;

---

### Visualization Design/Critique

When critiquing, ask: 
  * Which comparisons are automatic/perceptual? 
  * Which laborious/require calculation?

&lt;img src="figure/popout.png"/&gt;

---

### Discussion 9 - 1

What didn't we review? https://go.wisc.edu/rop674

* Identify one concept that we did not review today.
* Share a summary in your own words.
* Link to relevant material from the notes.
* Give a code example (if applicable).

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- In R's formula syntax, `.` is shorthand for "all variables." This is saying to --&gt;
&lt;!-- build a recipe using all variables as predictors, with none as the response. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} --&gt;
&lt;!-- umap_rec &lt;- recipe(~., data = pbmc) |&gt; # Why  ~. ?  why we want to swap x and y value? --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- `value` refers to the Principal Component value for that dimension. --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Formally: This column stores the vectors that define the PC subspace. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Informally: As we increase along that PC's direction, value describes how that coordinate is expected to change. --&gt;

&lt;!-- .center[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;img src="figure/tidy_value.png" width=400/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- In this example, we can argue that, --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{align} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \text{Gauguin } \sim 1.38 \text{PC}_{1} - 1.15 \text{PC}_{2} + 1.34 \text{PC}_{3} + \dots --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{align} --&gt;

&lt;!-- .center[ --&gt;
&lt;!--   &lt;img src="figure/pca_scores.png" width=600/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ] --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Exercise Review --&gt;

&lt;!-- In this example, we can argue that, --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{align} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \text{Gauguin } \sim 1.38 \text{PC}_{1} - 1.15 \text{PC}_{2} + 1.34 \text{PC}_{3} + \dots --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{align} --&gt;

&lt;!-- For example, if we use the first 5 PC dimensions, then the Light Rum coordinate --&gt;
&lt;!-- of the Gauguin should be roughly, --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{align} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \text{Gauguin}_{\text{Light Rum}} &amp;= 1.38 \times 0.163 - 1.15 \times \left(-0.112\right) + 1.34 \times 0.152 \\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- &amp;\approx 1.22 --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{align} --&gt;

&lt;!-- The actual value is 2. --&gt;

### Review

_How exactly does hierarchical clustering work?_

* This method works by merging similar samples from the bottom up.
* I realized that the images in the course notes were broken. I've fixed this, and we can review them now.
* https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat436_s24/posts/2024-12-27-week09-02

---

### Review

_When does it help to modify factor levels?_

* If we have an axis encoding categorical information, then it helps to order the categories by something meaningful.
 - Similarly, it helps to order facets deliberately
* Usually, we use `reorder()` directly within the `ggplot()` definition. This only works if the reordering operation is simple.
* More generally, we can manually change factor levels to update category/facet ordering.

* Examples: [Political science](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104706), [genetics](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412301112), [psychology](https://www.mskcc.org/sites/default/files/node/176881/documents/2019-06-03-16-06-14/li_schofield_gonen_dptutorial19.pdf), [evolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985471/), [epidemiology](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/goel.1/STAT825/PAPERS/CressiePPMC.pdf)
  - Typically problems where there is interest in a compact generative model.

### In-Class Exercise [13 - 1]

Prepare responses to [The top ten worst graphs] in the exercise sheet. You can
discuss with your team, but make submissions individually.

Prof. Broman has a delightful list of rogue data Visualizations:
[https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/)

a. Review 3 figures from the list *without* reading Prof. Broman's discussion
of them. Summarize the essential issues with the underlying visualization.

b. Again, without reading the discussion, propose an alternative way to
communicate the main message of the graphic.

c. Read the discussion. How does it complement your analysis? What shared data
visualization principles are you drawing from?
