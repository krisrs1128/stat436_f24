# STAT 436: Statistical Data Visualization

## Spring 2024



---


### Welcome!!

I'm excited to share this course with you this semester. There are few
activities that engage creative, quantitative, and critical thinking skills all
at once, but data visualization is one of them.

Nothing makes my day like a good data visualization, and I look forward to
seeing those that you create.

### Syllabus

* Learning outcomes
* Teaching team and office hours
* Assessments

### Learning Outcomes

1.	Develop a vocabulary of visual encodings that support exploration of
geospatial, temporal, tree-structured, and network data, and demonstrate
facility implementing them using packages in the R programming language.
1.	Design dynamic queries that support interactive visualization of
heterogeneous data, and demonstrate facility implementing them using the shiny
package in the R programming language.
1.	Design effective visualizations to summarize the results of dimensionality
reduction and clustering algorithms.

---

### Discussion Review

A few main themes came up in Thursday's discussion (https://go.wisc.edu/g0u74j)

* Making sense of Shiny-specific vocabulary and syntax
* Which Shiny components should we use when? What considerations guide the
choice?
* How to debug Shiny apps?

---

### Shiny-specific Syntax

What is the difference between `ui` and `server`?

* The `ui` defines what the user sees and can interact with.
* The `server` defines how the visualization responds to inputs.

---

### Shiny-specific Syntax

What is the difference between `observe` and `reactive`?

From Mastering Shiny, Section 3.6,

&gt; [S]ometimes you need to reach outside of the app and cause side-effects to
happen elsewhere in the world. This might be saving a file to a shared network
drive, sending data to a web API, updating a database, or (most commonly)
printing a debugging message to the console. These actions donâ€™t affect how your
app looks, so you shouldnâ€™t use an output and a render function. Instead you
need to use an observer.

---

### Which Components to Use When?

* For choosing between different inputs and outputs, the [Shiny Cheat
Sheet](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf) is helpful. It
shows screenshots of each type of input / output.
* Many authors have implemented inputs / outputs beyond those available in the main Shiny package. E.g., there are specialized widgets in the [`shinyWidgets`](https://shinyapps.dreamrs.fr/shinyWidgets/) package

---

### Which Components to Use When?

* For more complex displays, you may want to use `sidebarLayout`, `tabsetPanel`,
or `navbarPage`
* We will practice with alternatives during the Thursday demo

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

In addition to printing to the R console or inserting a `browser()` call, you
can create UI elements that print variables of interest.
  * `verbatimOutput` will print arbitrary R objects to the shiny UI



```r
server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  output$debug &lt;- verbatimOutput({
    # intermediate data structure 
  })
}
```

---

### Debugging Shiny Apps

A general principle for debugging: If you are very stuck, it helps to simplify
the problem. Pare away parts of the code that seem unrelated to the bug until
you arrive at a minimal example that reproduces the same buggy behavior. In the
process, you may discover the solution, and even if not, you will have a version
of the code that others can easily give feedback on.

---

### In-Class Demo [5 - 1]

* We will give a new solution to part (c) of [California Wildfires] in the
exercise sheet, but this time using graphical queries.
* Starter code is available here: https://go.wisc.edu/oldyzu

---

### In-Class Discussion [5 - 1]

Document: https://go.wisc.edu/2ac0fg

Prompt: Right now, the dotplot responds to the brushed histogram. However,

  * The dotplot does not allow any user inputs.
  * The histogram does not reflect year or user selections.

Imagine someone came to your statistical consulting hours with this application.
They want your expertise to improve the app so that it conveys more information.
How would you approach this? What might be some first steps towards
implementation?

---

### In-Class Exercise [5 - 1]

We will work through the [Code Analysis] exercise again, but for material from
Shiny. https://go.wisc.edu/3pr7v5

[Code Analysis] Pick one code example from this weekâ€™s lecture notes. Provide a
3 - 4 sentence summary of the overall implementation strategy. Then, add
comments every 10 - 15 lines describing what each section of code is doing. If
there are parts that you do not understand, add a ??? next to it (we will review
these in the next lecture).

### Exercise Review

Let's look at the most streamed song of 2017, which was "Shape of You." The
dataset
[here](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv)
contains the number of streams for this song across regions, for each day in
which it was in the Spotify 100 most streamed songs for that region. Create a
`tsibble` object from this dataset, keying by `region` and indexing by `date`.


```r
song &lt;- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hvplyr3jy6vbt7s80lqgfx81ai4hdl0q.csv")

### Review

_When would prior and posterior predictions be used?_

* Whenever you are using a Bayesian model and want to compare prior distributions / likelihood models.
* Examples: [Political science](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104706), [genetics](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412301112), [psychology](https://www.mskcc.org/sites/default/files/node/176881/documents/2019-06-03-16-06-14/li_schofield_gonen_dptutorial19.pdf), [evolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985471/), [epidemiology](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/goel.1/STAT825/PAPERS/CressiePPMC.pdf)
  - Typically problems where there is interest in a compact generative model.
 
_Can UMAP be said to be a dimensionality reduction method for 2D visualization?_

This is an appropriate interpretation, but be aware that you can reduce to more
than just two dimensions with UMAP.

### Conclusion

1. I have been impressed by your curiosity in the portfolios and projects.
1. Beyond the specific topics, remember the learning techniques: examples,
tinkering, and visual explanations.
1. There are many data analysis problems out there and too many people who fear
statistics -- use your visualization skills to help!
