The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())    
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```
Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions, (i)
How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii) On
which islands are which species found? 

```{r}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, col = species, shape = island))

ggplot(penguins,  aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col = species), size = 2, method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(size = 2, col = "black", method = "lm") +
  geom_point(aes(col = species), size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ island) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#b1236a", "#6ab123", "#236ab1")) +
  labs(x = "Bill Length", y = "Bill Depth", col = "Species", title = "Penguin Bill Stats") +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 36),
    title = element_text(size = 40),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 30),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 26),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 20)
  )
```
{}

* annotation - titles and axes
* size of the text  
* increase the size of the points
