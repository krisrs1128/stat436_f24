[Olympics Derivations] This problem gives some practice with deriving and visualizing new variables.

```{r}
olympics <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l.csv")
olympics
```

a. Create new columns for the city and country of birth for each athlete in the
London 2012 Olympics
[dataset](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l).

```{r}
olympics |>
    mutate(
        place_extracted = str_extract_all(`Place of birth`, "[A-z ]+")
    )  |>
    select(Name, `Place of birth`, place_extracted) |>
    unnest_wider(place_extracted, names_sep = "-")
```

b. Compute the standard deviation of athlete age within each sport. Which sport
has widest SD in age?

```{r}
olympics |>
    group_by(Sport) |>
    summarise(sd_age = sd(Age)) |>
    arrange(sd_age)
```


c. Make a visualization of sports against participant age. Sort sports by
age variance.

```{r}
keep_sports <- olympics |>
    count(Sport) |>
    filter(n > 5) |>
    pull(Sport)

keep_sports

olympics |>
    filter(Sport %in% keep_sports) |> 
    ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(
        Age, reorder(Sport, Age, sd)
    ))
```
